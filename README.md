# Codekata_Looping
Looping-based coding questions involve iterating over data structures using loops like for and while. These questions require you to perform repetitive tasks such as summing elements, filtering data, or transforming collections. Solutions typically demonstrate efficient loop usage and logical problem-solving techniques.
